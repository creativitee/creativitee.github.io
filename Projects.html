        <h1>Platek Can't find His Keys</h1>
        <p>To develop and present a working, bug free java program that incorporates advanced data structures and appropriate use of algorithms. 
            My team chose to work on a java based game using Processing which ran similar to a RPG and incorporated several puzzles including a key based puzzle. I worked mostly on the mapping and the algorithms to place the image files to make the maps while my partner worked on the boundaries and puzzle aspects. </p>
